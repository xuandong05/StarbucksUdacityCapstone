## Installation <a name="Installation"></a>
The code is written in Anaconda(Python 3) and the following libraries need to be installed:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Seaborn
4. MatplotLib
5. json
6. RandomForest
7. train_test_split 
8. r2_score, mean_squared_error
9. StandardScaler
10. tensorflow

## Motivation <a name="Motivation"></a>
This project is part of the Udacity Data Scientist program. The project used to create the data simulates how people make purchasing decisions and how those decisions are influenced by promotional offers. The given simulated data for the sake of testing algorithms, not simulated data for the sake of mimicking real people.
The goal of this project is to using models to see whether the people who receive the offer will complete the offer.
The approach to solving this problems are as follows:
- Data Exploration
- Data Preprocessing(cleaning)
- Questions and Visualization
- Modeling
- Conclusion
- Improvement

## Files <a name="Files"></a>
- portfolio: containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.).
- profile: demographic data for each customer.
- transcript: records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed.

## Repository Structure <a name="Structure"></a>
The ipynb file is the code file containing all the codes written to clean and wrangling, to analyzing data and producing model and graphs.

## Results <a name="Results"></a>

## Licensing, Authors,Acknowledgement <a name="Acknowledgement"></a>
The data was given by Starbucks and Udacity.
